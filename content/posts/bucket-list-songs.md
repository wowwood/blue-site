One thing I've often had an affliction for is a bucket list dictated by songs. What does that mean exactly? Well, it's quite simple. Some songs are named after places or things to do...so I always try to find a way to combine the two.

So far I have managed to listen to:

Africa in Africa

_Africa - Toto_

Autobahn on the Autobahn (the entire 27 min edit)

_Autobahn - Kraftwerk_

Wheels on the Bus on the bus

_Wheels on the Bus - Venjent_

Under da sea under the sea

_Under da sea - the little mermaid_

BEWTS on the Stena Line

_BEWTS_
