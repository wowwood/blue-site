        <p class="govuk-heading-m">Electromagnetic Field 2024 - Eastnor, UK</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">How do you transmit data when there’s 205,000 people trying to access the same mobile
          network in a field? Satellites, of course! After facing dilemmas of tracking the staff shuttles at a major UK
          festival, we decided to look at other options and discovered some cheap Iridium satellite constellation
          hardware on eBay.<br><br> When they arrived, we surveyed what we had purchased, discovered it was ex-Ministry
          of Defense hardware, and hasn’t been scrubbed properly. After getting a new pair of trousers and making the
          relevant disclosures, we worked to reverse engineer the hardware and get some usable data transmitting into
          space (and back down).</p>

        <p class="govuk-heading-m">MIPI Alliance Member Meeting #62 - Lisbon, Portugal</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Being the opening presentation of the meeting, I spoke to MIPI members about milestones in
          mobile phone history, from the brick phone in the 1980s, to foldables in the present day. This prompted lively
          discussions and stoked interest in the Mobile Phone Museum project.</p>
