        <p class="govuk-body">How do you transmit data when thereâ€™s 205,000 people trying to access the same mobile
          network in a field? Satellites, of course! After facing dilemmas of tracking the staff shuttles at a major UK
          festival, we decided to look at other options and discovered some cheap Iridium satellite constellation
          hardware on eBay.<br><br> When they arrived, we surveyed what we had purchased, discovered it was ex-Ministry
          of Defense hardware, and hasnâ€™t been scrubbed properly. After getting a new pair of trousers and making the
          relevant disclosures, we worked to reverse engineer the hardware and get some usable data transmitting into
          space (and back down).</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Being the opening presentation of the meeting, I spoke to MIPI members about milestones in
          mobile phone history, from the brick phone in the 1980s, to foldables in the present day. This prompted lively
